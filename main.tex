\section{Overview}

This document describes the design of the RiscyOO processor, which has been released publicly at \url{https://github.com/csail-csg/riscy-OOO}.
RiscyOO implements the RISC-V 64-bit instruction set with the IMAFD extensions, i.e., RV64G.
It is a out-of-order superscalar multiprocessor which can boot multicore Linux and AWS F1 FPGA.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/system_crop.pdf}
    \caption{Overall system}\label{fig:sys}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sys} shows the overall system.
The RiscyOO processor is implemented on the AWS FPGA.
The FPGA is connected to a x86 host machine via PCIe.
The x86 host machine runs a piece of software to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize the processor on FPGA (e.g., copy Linux image to the DRAM of FPGA).
    \item Receive character outputs from the processor on FPGA and display the characters on the terminal of the x86 host.
    This communication is using the HTIF protocol, which is used in the RISC-V ISA simulator Spike (\url{https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim}).
    \item Send keyboard input on the x86 host to the processor on FPGA.
    This communication is also using the HTIF protocol.
    \item Query performance counters in the processor on FPGA.
    \item Receive terminate signals from FPGA.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Document Organization:}
Section~\ref{sec:core} describes the processor-core microarchitectures.
In particular, we describe the interface (including conflict matrices), implementation, future improvement and the path of source files for important modules.
As a convention, we use ``\code{//}'' to denote the root of the git repo when referring to the path of source files.
Section~\ref{sec:uncore} describes the uncore, including the shared L2 cache, DRAM, etc.
Section~\ref{sec:sw} describes the software running on the x86 host machine.
Section~\ref{sec:bench} lists the git repos for the benchmark programs that have been run on the processor.

\section{Processor Core}\label{sec:core}

Figure~\ref{fig:core} shows the overall structure of the processor core.
Modules are represented by boxes.
The main processor pipeline is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fetch pipeline $\rightarrow$ Rename stage $\rightarrow$ ROB and all execution pipelines (ALU/Branch, FPU/Int-Mul/Int-Div, and Mem) $\rightarrow$ Commit stage.
\end{itemize}
The rename stage divides the processor core into the front-end and the back-end.
The front-end, i.e., the fetch pipeline, is an in-order pipeline, while out-of-order execution happens all in the back-end.

An instruction is fetched and decoded in the fetch pipeline.
The rename stage performs register renaming and enters the instruction int ROB and one of the execution pipelines.
When the instruction finishes execution and leaves the execution pipeline, it notifies the ROB that it is executed.
Finally the commit stage commits instructions from ROB in order.

Below we introduce some basic information about the core, which is not tied to each specific module.

\noindent\textbf{Superscalarity:}
The processor core is also superscalar.
The fetch pipeline, rename stage and commit stage can all handle multiple instructions in one cycle.
\emph{The size of superscalarity is represented by numeric type \code{SupSize} in the source code and in the rest of this document.}
The core also has multiple execution pipelines.
The numbers of ALU/Branch (abbreviated as ALU in the following) execution pipelines and FPU/Int-Mul/Int-Div execution pipelines (abbreviated as FPU execution pipeline in the following) are parametrized.
However, there can only be one memory execution pipeline

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/core_crop.pdf}
    \caption{Overall structure of the processor core}\label{fig:core}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Scheduling Convention:}
Since there are many modules in the core, assigning conflict matrices to different module interfaces to maximize the concurrency of rules can be difficult.
To simplify the problem, we following the convention of \emph{reverse pipeline ordering} in assigning conflict matrices.
\emph{That is, rules representing later stages in the processor pipeline (e.g., commit) are ordered before rules representing earlier stages (e.g., rename), and thus, interface methods called in later stages are ordered before methods called in earlier stages.}

Another principle in scheduling is to have common rules fire concurrently.
\emph{It is ok to have uncommon rules (e.g., mis-speculation) conflict with each other and even common rules.}

\noindent\textbf{System Instructions:}
Some instructions can change the context of the processor and are difficult to be executed out of order or concurrently with other instructions.
These instructions are called \emph{system instructions}, and include the following instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \inst{ECALL} which makes a system call,
    \item \inst{EBREAK} which traps for debugger,
    \item \inst{SRET} and \inst{MRET} which return from trap handling,
    \item \inst{SFENCE.VMA} which flushes the TLBs, and
    \item \inst{FENCE.I} which is used for self-modifying code.
\end{itemize}
System instructions are executed in a blocking way, i.e., the instruction will be the only instruction in the ROB.


\noindent\textbf{Detecting Interrupt:}
We detect interrupts at \emph{rename} stage (instead of commit stage).
When an interrupt is detected, the current instruction at the rename stage will be turned into a special instruction which represents the interrupt.
The instruction will be entered into ROB and get processed at the commit stage.
Here we assume the fetch pipeline will keep delivering instructions to the rename stage, i.e., there is no low-power mode which turns off instruction fetch.

The benefits of detecting interrupts at rename stage is to ensure that all instructions in ROB are not affected by interrupts.
As a result, out-of-order commits may be possible, though we did not implement any out-of-order commits.

\noindent\textbf{Read-After-Write Hazards for CSRs:}
Our implementation ensures that there is no read-after-write hazards on CSRs in the processor.
CSRs can be modified by system instructions, exceptions, interrupts, and floating-point instructions.
The invariant of no read-after-write hazards on CSRs is guaranteed in the following way: at the rename stage, if we see a system instruction (i.e., \inst{CSRRW}), we enters the instruction into the ROB only if ROB is empty, and we flush the fetch pipeline at the same time.
As a result, there cannot be any hazards regarding the writes on CSRs by system instructions, exceptions or interrupts.

As for the hazards regarding the writes on CSRs by floating-point instructions.
We notice that only the \inst{CSRRW} instruction, which is a system instruction, can read the CSRs modified by floating-point instructions.
Therefore, the writes by floating-point instructions cannot cause any hazards.

It should be noted that there is no write-after-write or write-after-read hazards on CSRs, because all CSR writes are made at commit stage.

\noindent\textbf{Organization:}
In the rest of this section, we first introduce the general mechanism to control speculation in the back-end (Section~\ref{sec:specupdate}), and then describe each modules and top-level rules.

\section{Uncore}\label{sec:uncore}

Figure~\ref{fig:uncore} shows the uncore system.
The L2 cache connects to the DRAM and is shared by all the L1 caches.
The MMIO platform module is connected to all the MMIO handler modules (Section~\ref{sec:mmio-core}) in the processor cores.
It handles all the MMIO requests from the cores to access all the MMIO devices, and post interrupts to the cores.
The boot rom is a MMIO device which contains a piece of RISC-V code that is run at the very beginning when the processor starts up.
The code zeros the architectural registers, configures the CSRs, and requests the x86 host to initialize the memory content through the memory loader module.
The memory loader module is another MMIO device that transfers data (Linux image) from the x86 host the memory system (via the coherent L2 cache).
In the following, we will explain each module in the uncore system.
