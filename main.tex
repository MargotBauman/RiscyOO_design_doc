\section{Overview}


\section{Processor Core}

Figure~\ref{fig:core} shows the overall structure of the processor core.
Modules are represented by boxes.
The main processor pipeline is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fetch pipeline $\rightarrow$ Rename stage $\rightarrow$ ROB and all execution pipelines (ALU/Branch, FPU/Int-Mul/Int-Div, and Mem) $\rightarrow$ Commit stage.
\end{itemize}
The rename stage divides the processor core into the front-end and the back-end.
The front-end, i.e., the fetch pipeline, is an in-order pipeline, while out-of-order execution happens all in the back-end.

An instruction is fetched and decoded in the fetch pipeline.
The rename stage performs register renaming and enters the instruction int ROB and one of the execution pipelines.
When the instruction finishes execution and leaves the execution pipeline, it notifies the ROB that it is executed.
Finally the commit stage commits instructions from ROB in order.

Below we introduce some basic information about the core, which is not tied to each specific module.

\noindent\textbf{Superscalarity:}
The processor core is also superscalar.
The fetch pipeline, rename stage and commit stage can all handle multiple instructions in one cycle.
\emph{The size of superscalarity is represented by numeric type \code{SupSize} in the source code and in the rest of this document.}
The core also has multiple execution pipelines.
The numbers of ALU/Branch (abbreviated as ALU in the following) execution pipelines and FPU/Int-Mul/Int-Div execution pipelines (abbreviated as FPU execution pipeline in the following) are parametrized.
However, there can only be one memory execution pipeline

\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Scheduling Convention:}
Since there are many modules in the core, assigning conflict matrices to different module interfaces to maximize the concurrency of rules can be difficult.
To simplify the problem, we following the convention of \emph{reverse pipeline ordering} in assigning conflict matrices.
\emph{That is, rules representing later stages in the processor pipeline (e.g., commit) are ordered before rules representing earlier stages (e.g., rename), and thus, interface methods called in later stages are ordered before methods called in earlier stages.}

Another principle in scheduling is to have common rules fire concurrently.
\emph{It is ok to have uncommon rules (e.g., mis-speculation) conflict with each other and even common rules.}

\noindent\textbf{System Instructions:}
Some instructions can change the context of the processor and are difficult to be executed out of order or concurrently with other instructions.
These instructions are called \emph{system instructions}, and include the following instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \inst{ECALL} which makes a system call,
    \item \inst{EBREAK} which traps for debugger,
    \item \inst{SRET} and \inst{MRET} which return from trap handling,
    \item \inst{SFENCE.VMA} which flushes the TLBs, and
    \item \inst{FENCE.I} which is used for self-modifying code.
\end{itemize}
System instructions are executed in a blocking way, i.e., the instruction will be the only instruction in the ROB.


\noindent\textbf{Detecting Interrupt:}
We detect interrupts at \emph{rename} stage (instead of commit stage).
When an interrupt is detected, the current instruction at the rename stage will be turned into a special instruction which represents the interrupt.
The instruction will be entered into ROB and get processed at the commit stage.
Here we assume the fetch pipeline will keep delivering instructions to the rename stage, i.e., there is no low-power mode which turns off instruction fetch.

The benefits of detecting interrupts at rename stage is to ensure that all instructions in ROB are not affected by interrupts.
As a result, out-of-order commits may be possible, though we did not implement any out-of-order commits.

\noindent\textbf{Read-After-Write Hazards for CSRs:}
Our implementation ensures that there is no read-after-write hazards on CSRs in the processor.
CSRs can be modified by system instructions, exceptions, interrupts, and floating-point instructions.
The invariant of no read-after-write hazards on CSRs is guaranteed in the following way: at the rename stage, if we see a system instruction (i.e., \inst{CSRRW}), we enters the instruction into the ROB only if ROB is empty, and we flush the fetch pipeline at the same time.
As a result, there cannot be any hazards regarding the writes on CSRs by system instructions, exceptions or interrupts.

As for the hazards regarding the writes on CSRs by floating-point instructions.
We notice that only the \inst{CSRRW} instruction, which is a system instruction, can read the CSRs modified by floating-point instructions.
Therefore, the writes by floating-point instructions cannot cause any hazards.

It should be noted that there is no write-after-write or write-after-read hazards on CSRs, because all CSR writes are made at commit stage.

\noindent\textbf{Organization:}
In the rest of this section, we first introduce the general mechanism to control speculation in the back-end (Section~\ref{sec:specupdate}), and then describe each modules and top-level rules.
