\subsection{FPU (and Integer Multiply/Divide) Execution Pipeline}

The FPU execution pipeline is very similar to the ALU execution pipeline (Section~\ref{sec:alu-exe-pip}).
The only difference is that instead of computing the result in a single rule, the \code{doExe} rule sends the instruction to the FPU module or the integer multiply and divide module for computation.
The \code{doFinish} rule will pick up the instructions outputted by these two submodules.
We skip the details here.
