\subsection{FPU (and Integer Multiply/Divide) Execution Pipeline}

The FPU execution pipeline is very similar to the ALU execution pipeline (Section~\ref{sec:alu-exe-pip}).
The differences are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instead of computing the result in a single rule, the \code{doExe} rule sends the instruction to the FPU module or the integer multiply and divide module for computation.
    The \code{doFinish} rule will pick up the instructions outputted by these two submodules.
    \item This pipeline receives data bypassing from the ALU execution pipelines, but it does not send out any data bypassing.
\end{itemize}
 is that 

We skip the details here.
