\subsection{Memory Loader}
The memory loader module is responsible for initializing the DRAM.
It has the following two MMIO registers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start register (0x0100\_0000):
    Writing to this register will result in telling the x86 host software to transfer the contents of BBL (Linux image) to the FPGA to initialize the DRAM.
    The write data should be the physical address of the starting point of the (non-MMIO) main memory.
    This write data will also be sent to the x86 host software for a sanity check.
    \item Busy register (0x0100\_0008): is a read-only register.
    It is one if the initialization of DRAM is ongoing.
    The boot-rom program spins on this register to determine if the initialization is done or not.
\end{itemize}
We skip the details of the implementation.
