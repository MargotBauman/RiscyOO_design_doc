\subsection{DRAM}

The DRAM module is a wrapper over the DRAM IP core on AWS F1 FPGA.
Our L2 cache assumes that DRAM will keep requests to the same address in order.
However, the DRAM IP core on AWS FPGA exposes an AXI interface which does not order a read and a write to the same address.
This is because reads and writes are on different channels in an AXI interface.
This DRAM-wrapper module includes a write buffer on top of DRAM to enforce the necessary ordering required by the L2 cache.

\subsubsection{Future Improvement}
This module also enforces the ordering of an older read and a younger write by having a read buffer to track the in-flight read addresses.
Enforcing this ordering is unnecessary, because write-after-read hazards can never arise according to the protocol used in the L2 cache.
We may remove the read buffer in future.
