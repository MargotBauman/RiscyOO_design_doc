\subsection{L2-DRAM Converter}

This module connects L2 cache to DRAM.
It has the following two major functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Translate RISC-V physical addresses to DRAM addresses:
    The L2 cache uses the physical addresses.
    In RISC-V, the physical address of DRAM starts from 0x8000\_0000.
    To fully utilize the DRAM storage, this module offsets the addresses from L2 cache before any requests are sent to the DRAM.
    
    \item Model the bandwidth and latency of DRAM:
    The relative speed of DRAM compared to the processor core on FPGA is much faster than that in a real machine.
    To evaluate performance with more accuracy, this module adds a timing model on DRAM.
    That is, this module forces each DRAM request to take a constant latency (which is much longer than the DRAM latency on FPGA), and limits the number of inflight DRAM requests (which effectively models a constant bandwidth).
\end{itemize}
